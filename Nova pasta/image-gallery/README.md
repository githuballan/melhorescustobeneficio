# Image Gallery Project

This project is an image gallery that allows users to navigate through a collection of images using navigation arrows. It also provides a preview of the images below the main display area.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

```
image-gallery
├── css
│   └── styles.css        # Styles for the image gallery
├── js
│   └── script.js         # JavaScript functionality for the gallery
├── images
│   ├── image1.jpg       # First image in the gallery
│   ├── image2.jpg       # Second image in the gallery
│   ├── image3.jpg       # Third image in the gallery
│   └── image4.jpg       # Fourth image in the gallery
├── index.html            # Main HTML document for the gallery
└── README.md             # Documentation for the project
```

## Getting Started

To set up the image gallery, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser. This file contains the main structure of the gallery and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

3. **Navigate through the images** using the left and right arrow buttons. The main image display will update accordingly, and you can see the thumbnail previews below.

## Customization

You can customize the gallery by:

- Adding more images to the `images` directory and updating the `index.html` file to include them.
- Modifying the styles in `css/styles.css` to change the appearance of the gallery.
- Updating the JavaScript in `js/script.js` to add more functionality or change the navigation behavior.
